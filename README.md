# virtualAssistant

A simple virtual assistant created in python, as a small side project. Similar to my discord bot (https://github.com/calvinz168/pnuts-Discord-Bot), the assistant has multiple utilities such as: telling you the weather, the current time, responding to specific commands, and Google searching for given prompts.
